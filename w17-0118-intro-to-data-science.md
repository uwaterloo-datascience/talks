# Welcome to DSC's Winter 2017 Weeklies!

These notes are from Winter 2017's first weekly event. For more events, make sure you've signed up for notifications from our Facebook group at [Waterloo Data Science Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1667117806888083/).

Notes are not comprehensive, come to weekly sessions to hear the full discussions, meet teammates, and more!

# Cornerstones of data science

There's a wealth of tools for data science. Where do you get started? Luckily for you, Jason Liu's narrowed it down to three core areas.
Here are the things you should master:

##### data transforms:
SQL, [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr)

- Sarth recommends [SQLZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/) for picking up SQL

  - Jason: "+1 got me through facebook interviews"


- Jason recommends [Pandas From The Ground Up - PyCon on YouTube](https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw) for learning pandas from scratch

- Jason says `dplyr` is much nicer to use than `pandas`, and doesn't require memorizing as much documentation

##### modelling:
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), glm (generalized linear model)
- if these are powerful enough for Yelp's recommendation engine, they're powerful enough for nearly all of your data science use cases too

  - protip: if Jason is your interviewer, don't mention neural networks unless you want to be rejected all the way into deepdream hell.

  - jokes aside, know your basics and develop stats maturity.

Courses you can take to learn more about these concepts:

- [STAT 331: Applied Linear Models](https://uwflow.com/course/stat331)

- [STAT 431: Generalized Linear Models and their Applications](https://uwflow.com/course/stat431)

- [STAT 444: Statistical Learning - Function Estimation](https://uwflow.com/course/stat444)

#### reporting:
[ipython](https://ipython.org/),
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- lets you run code and write text all on one page

These are the best way for communicating your results, hands down. Always include an ipython notebook with your analysis, or write one up as a standalone!


### other:
[tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) is a set of R packages that work well together and make data analysis much smoother.

It includes `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, which are in these notes.

A great resource to learn everything tidyverse is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

### visualization:

Again, `ggplot2`.

also note: companies love people who can [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

# Challenge

Go to [halite.io](halite.io) and try running a bot.

This is an easy way to get started for those itching to try an AI programming challenge.

Cost is nothing, rewards are great!

The starter bot is just a few lines of code, and there's lots of room for improvement.

Some non-trivial incentives:

- potential to skip first round interviews with TwoSigma, a data science / software engineering finance company of ex-Googlers (they've also got a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling) going on right now that you might want to check out)

- glory for your handle and for our school
- and rarest of all: Ben Zhang will bestow on you a free large pizza from Campus Pizza (or Domino's b/c apparently there's a discount available or something) if you make silver

  - condition: has to be before next Wednesday (Jan 25)

    - your clock is ticking.


# Random news
- Google's using Keras as the official high-level library for Tensorflow

- Good luck on WaterlooWorks!
